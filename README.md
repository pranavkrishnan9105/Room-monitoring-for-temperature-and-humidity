# Room-monitoring-for-temperature-and-humidity
this is a Simple project made to monitor the Temperature and Humidity of your current atmosphere.This uses  a DHT11 temperature and Humidity Sensor Together with an 128 X 64 OLED Display. Initially I used a 1602 LCD but I thought that OLED displays Output data in a Much nicer and Compact way, And it can be applied to Many smart home appliances.
